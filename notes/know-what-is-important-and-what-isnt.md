> So a good leader detaches and elevates above the tactical situation, where they can see what really matter. Before they dive into a problem, they ask themselves questions. _How will this problem impact the team's strategic goals? Can it cause mission failure?? Is it worth my time and effort to engage in it?? How bad can it get if I leave it alone?
