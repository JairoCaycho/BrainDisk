## Principles
1. __KISS__ - Keep It Simple, Stupid.
2. __DRY__ - Don't Repeat Yourself.
3. __YAGNI__ - You Aren't Gonna Need It.
4. Structure has to build itself around the content, not the other way around. (bottom-up approach)

## Tags
1. Are never a topic or a subject.
2. Only describe what is the title. Is easier to understand it with examples:
  - `#source.(form)` the title refers to a source in the form of a document, book, article, etc.
  - `#question` - the title is literally a question.
  - `#process` - the title is the name of a process.
  - `#quote` - the title is a quote.
